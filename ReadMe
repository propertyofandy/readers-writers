Overview:
    The reader writer problem is a classical synchronization problem in 
    computer science. This problem arises when you have multiple threads 
    reading and writing to a shared resource, typically one thread will
    be designated a writer and the rest readers. This is done because 
    the only time race conditions occur when data is mutated. Which is
    also why mutability, functional languages, control flow concepts 
    where created. 

Description:
    This project is my take on the reader writers problem in c++
    that uses template and interface to generalize the problem.
    This allows us to manage shared resources of any type that implements 
    ISharedResources. In this example I chose to demonstrate the problem with a binary where n readers will be reading from the tree and a writer will be 
    adding nodes.
